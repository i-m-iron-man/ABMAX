    "## Step 1: Defining the agent\n",
    "Agents in ABMAX are defined using a class that inherits from the `Agent` class.\n",
    "They are also decorated with `@struct.dataclass` from `Flax` to make them similar to a jax primitive data type (something that passes through jax vmaps, jits and grads without throwing errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Agent` class must have the following simple members:\n",
    "- `id`: An integer that uniquely identifies the agent.\n",
    "- `agent_type`: An integer that represents the type of the agent.\n",
    "- `active_state`: A boolean that represents if the agent is active or not.\n",
    "- `age`: A float that represents the age of the agent in the simulation.\n",
    "- `key`: A jax random key that is used to generate randomness when need be.\n",
    "The `Agent` class must also have the following complex members:\n",
    "- `state`: A `State` object that represents the state of the agent that evolves over time.\n",
    "- `params`: A `Params` object that represents the parameters of the agent that ideally do not change over time.\n",
    "- `policy`: A `Policy` object that represents the policy of the agent that determines the actions of the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about `State`, `Params`, `Policy` and other helper classes can be found in the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To comply with the functional programming paradigm that jax requires, as well as, to include some 'OOPness', the methods of an `Agent` class are defined as static methods that take the agent as the first argument.\n"

    "- `create_agent(type, params, id, active_state, key)`: Creates a new dice agent. Note how we create active and inactive agents separately according to the agent's active state. This is needed to create an agent \"zero-padding\" which inturn makes sure that the total number of agents in the collection of agents is fixed. This is the only method whose name is fixed and must be defined in the agent class. About the arguments:\n",
    "    - `type`: The type of the agent.\n",
    "    - `params`: The parameters used to create the agent.\n",

    "    - `active_state`: The active state of the agent.\n",
    "    - `key`: The random key of the agent.\n",

    "- `step_agent(agent, input, step_params)`: Tells us how should an agent step. Here it steps by sampling a number between 1 and 6 and storing it in the agent's state by updating it. Again, note how we step active and inactive agents separately. This is so that we can vmap over the agents to step them in parallel. While vmapping, the parameters `agent` and `input` are vectorized so that different agents can get different inputs, but the `step_params` is not vectorized, so that all agents get the same `step_params`. Conventionally, we can use the `policy` data structure of the agent to determine the action of the agent. Here, for simplicity, we ignore it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `remove_agent(agents, idx, remove_params)`: Produces a blank agent. This is called when we want to remove an agent from the collection of agents. Here, `agents` is the collection of agents, `idx` is the index where the agent should be removed from and `remove_params` are the parameters needed to produce the blank agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `add_agent(agents, idx, add_params)`: Produces an agent that can be added. This is called when we want to add an agent to the collection. Here, `agents` is, again, the collection of agents, `idx` is the index where the agent should be added and `add_params` are the parameters needed to produce the agents that is added. \n",
